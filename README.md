# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as a simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8090/  

Change default port value in application.properties

This package requires the installation of MongoDB as the underlying database. Please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed.


## Prerequisites
Homebrew

MongoDB

Maven

Tomcat Server


## Install
If you do not have Homebrew installed, please follow instructions at: http://brew.sh/

Install MongoDB by:

Run 'brew install mongodb'

After installation, start your mongo database server (note -dbpath optional paramter)

Run 'mongod --dbpath=/Database/Mongo'

In another terminal window, execute the script included in this folder (/database/mongo.js):

Run 'mongo /database/mongo.js'

This will take care of installing the mongo dependency and creating a database with minimal test data.

Build the project with maven from the root of this directory:

Run 'mvn clean install'

This will generate swagger code and compile the source. The intention of this project is to run in a Tomcat server, follow instructions on starting the application at:
